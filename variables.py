# Variables in Python are containers or labels that store data values.
#  They are fundamental building blocks in programming that allow you to store and manipulate information.

name = "risbin" # string 
age = 22         # integer
is_adult = True # boolean
price = 22.22 # float
number = 1 + 2j # complex number
number = [1,2,3] # list
number = (1,2,3) # tuple

print("hai may name is ",name , "and my age is ", age , "my watch price is ",price)



# Single assignment
x = 10

# Multiple assignment
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3

# Same value to multiple variables
x = y = z = 0
